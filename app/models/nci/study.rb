     "II. To evaluate the safety profile of crizotinib when given in the adjuvant therapy setting.\r\n" +
     "III. To collect tumor tissue and blood specimens for future research.\r\n" +
     "\r\n" +
     "OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\r\n" +
     "\r\n" +
     "ARM A: Patients receive crizotinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n" +
     "\r\n" +
     "ARM B: Patients undergo observation.\r\n" +
     "\r\n" +
     "After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months if < 4 or 5 years from study entry, and every 12 months if 5-10 or 6-10 years from study entry.",
